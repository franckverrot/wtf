Wtf - Work The Flow
===================

Experimental workflow tool.

The DSL that `wtf` exposes should cover most of the usage companies and
individuals have in their development process.

`wtf` is highly configurable and if you don't think it fits your
methodologies, please fill-in a ticket!

It's not yet a gem, so if you use that repository, please only run

    bundle install
    bin/wtf
